### quickbooks integration 
- figure out quickbooks API 
- john has a "quickbooks online account" 
- ideal situation would be for someone to receive an invoice the 
day after their last lesson of each month, different for 
different clients
	-- look into triggers, triggering based on changes in 
calendars 
	-- 


### google form 
- end of day with lessons, email instructor and ask if the lesson 
happened
- based on their responses, it would update the calendar
